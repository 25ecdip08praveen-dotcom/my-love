      Dear Ramya,

```
  I wanted to leave this here for you. Some things are better written than said. 💙
  
  I don’t know where to begin, because whenever I think about you, my heart speaks louder than my words. Still, I want to try—because you deserve to know how deeply you mean to me. 🥺
```

From the moment you came into my life, something changed inside me. You didn’t just become a person I cared about; you became a feeling, a comfort, a quiet strength I never knew I needed. 💙 In a world that keeps rushing forward, you became the moment where everything slowed down and felt real.
Every smile of yours feels like home. 🥺 Every word you speak stays with me longer than it should, replaying in my mind like my favorite song. 💙 You don’t even realize how powerful your presence is—how simply being you can make someone’s day brighter, someone’s heart lighter. For me, that someone is always me.
What I admire most about you is not just your beauty, but your heart. 💙 Your kindness, your patience, your strength—even when things aren’t easy, you stand firm. You inspire me to be better, to grow, to believe that love doesn’t have to be loud to be real. Sometimes, it’s silent, steady, and deeply meaningful—just like you. 🥺
There are memories with you that I will carry forever. 💙 Moments that may seem small to the world, but to me, they are priceless. They remind me that love isn’t about perfection; it’s about connection, understanding, and choosing someone every day—even on the hard days. 🥺
I don’t know what the future holds, but I know this much: having you in my life has already made my journey more beautiful. 💙 Whether near or far, in laughter or silence, a part of my heart will always wish for your happiness, your peace, and your dreams to come true.
Ramya, thank you—for being you, for the memories, for the lessons, and for the love you’ve shown in ways you may never fully realize. 💙 You will always have a special place in my heart, one that no time or distance can erase. 🥺

```
  Always wishing you the best 💙

  — Praveen
